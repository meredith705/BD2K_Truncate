# BD2K_Truncate
BRCA Variant Translation Truncation Project

Hello,

My name is Melissa Meredith. I am a Molecular Biology Major at California State University, Monterey Bay. 
I am a Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Scholar working in Dr. Melissa Cline's Genomics Lab
for the summer of 2017. 

My project is to identify variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that cause truncation of the resulting protein. 
I will be using the variant ID in HGVS nomenclature to determine if the variant changes the translation frame. 
I will also be using Mualyzer to identify exon locations in the sequence.
